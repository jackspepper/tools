# Changelog

## 0.3.1-package - current

### Stripping down for repo consolidation
- Stripped out standalone github repo requirements (such as Github actions) so this can be consolidated into jackspepper/tools repo as a tool.
- The main repo [jackspepper/qPCR-pipeline](https://github.com/jackspepper/qPCR-pipeline) shall remain private as a legacy remainder of the scripts and initial packaging.

## 0.3.0-dev

### R Package Refactoring
- Converted script-based repository into an installable R package (`qpcrpipeline`).
- Exposed core pipelines as exportable functions: `run_cleaning_pipeline()` and `run_consolidation_pipeline()`.
- Designed pipeline functions to return directory paths to enable native R (`|>`) and `magrittr` (`%>%`) piping.
- Added `use_qpcr_template()` to dynamically bootstrap new project folders with raw data structures and runner scripts.
- Removed obsolete version check script (`R/get_version.R`) and replaced with standard R package versioning via `DESCRIPTION`.
- Relocated example files to package assets (`inst/example_project/`).

### GitHub & Infrastructure
- Created standard R `.gitignore` to prevent committing local RStudio caches, packages, logs, and biological datasets.
- Created `qPCR-pipeline.Rproj` to automatically set the working directory to the project root in RStudio.
- Added GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`) to build, install, and test the package on example data.
- Added templates for Bug Reports, Feature Requests, and Pull Requests.
